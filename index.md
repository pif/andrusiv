Hi there! My name is **Ostap Andrusiv, Product Manager** at [GetSocial.im](https://www.getsocial.im). At GetSocial we increase virality and social engagement for Ubisoft, SEGA, and multiple indie developers. With our SDK developers can build word of mouth referral marketing mechanics and in-app communities.

Before GetSocial I spent 6 years as **R&amp;D Engineer, Presales Engineer, and Software Architect** at software consultancy agency [ELEKS](https://eleks.com/). We built time tracking solutions for top US lawyers, privacy and identity management software used in Fortune 500 companies and controlled Tesla from Google Glass and other wearables.

I understand, that **big things are built in teams** and enjoy working with people smarter than me. I enjoy **quick prototyping, fast iterations, and experiments**. If you know a way to speed up experiments in B2B SaaS companies with high-touch low-volume sales, please write me a message. Would be happy to chat about that!

Over the last 5 years, I **shared my experience** at multiple conferences worldwide: Droidcon London, Mobile World Congress,  Wearables TechCon, Apps World, Android Dev Days, ProductTank Meetups, GDG Meetups and others. My main areas of interest are **mobile growth, analytics, mobile software development**. I know how to prepare a talk and make sure that audience doesn't fall asleep. Feel free to [ping me](mailto:ostap@andrusiv.com?subject=Let&#39;s%20Meet), if you want me to speak at your event.

Together with a team of 10 software engineers, we **organize [GDG DevFest Ukraine](https://devfest.gdg.org.ua) -- the biggest Google tech conference in CEE region**: 2 days, 4 streams (mobile, web, cloud, and workshops), 40+ international speakers, 1000+ attendees (90% - engineers). We've organized this conference for 7 years in a row now. Speakers tell their fellow friend speakers not to miss our [C4P](https://sessionize.com/dfua). 95% of attendees respond with "enjoyed, would like to come back!" in feedback form. We do all of this on a voluntary basis. And we love what we do.

If you have any questions, write me an [email](mailto:ostap@andrusiv.com?subject=Let&#39;s%20Talk) or mention on [twitter](https://twitter.com/p1f).
