Hi there! 
My name is **Ostap Andrusiv, Director of Growth Analytics** at [DataRobot](https://datarobot.com/). DataRobot offers an end-to-end machine learning platform for data scientists of all skill levels to build and productionize machine learning models in a fraction of the time. Give it a [try](https://www.datarobot.com/trial) yourself. The first time I used it, I was able to build a high quality explainable churn prediction model in 20 minutes. Putting it in production was just a few clicks away.

Before DataRobot I spent 3 years as a **Product Manager** at [GetSocial.im](https://www.getsocial.im) â€“ marketing automation, analytics, and social engagement mobile SDK for developers. Customers like Ubisoft, SEGA, and multiple indie developers used our SDK to build word of mouth referral marketing mechanics, in-app communities, and tracked analytics of their mobile apps.

Before GetSocial I spent 6 years as **R&amp;D Engineer, Presales Engineer, and Software Architect** at software consultancy agency [ELEKS](https://eleks.com/). We built time tracking solutions for top US lawyers, privacy and identity management software used in Fortune 500 companies and controlled Tesla from Google Glass and other wearables.

I used to speak at multiple conferences worldwide: Droidcon London, Mobile World Congress, Apps World, ProductTank Meetups, GDG Meetups, and others. My main areas of interest are **growth, analytics, applied machine learning**. I used to organize conferences too. With a team of 10 friends, we **organized [GDG DevFest Ukraine](https://devfest.gdg.org.ua) -- the biggest Google tech conference in CEE region**: 2 days, 4 streams (mobile, web, cloud, and workshops), 40+ international speakers, 1000+ attendees (90% - engineers). We've organized this conference for 7 years in a row and grew it from 300 to 1000+ attendees. 95% of attendees responded with "enjoyed, would like to come back!" in feedback form.

I understand, that **big things are built in teams** and enjoy working with people smarter than me. I enjoy **quick prototyping, fast iterations, and experiments**. If you know a way to speed up experiments in B2B SaaS companies with high-touch low-volume sales, please write me a message. Would be happy to chat about that!

If you have any questions, write me an [email](mailto:ostap@andrusiv.com?subject=Let&#39;s%20Talk) or mention [@p1f](https://twitter.com/p1f) on twitter.
